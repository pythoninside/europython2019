# Keep Those Ducks in (Type) Check!
## How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Type Checker
#### _Francesco Pierfederici ([Python Inside](https://pythoninside.com))_

PEP 484 (building upon PEP 3107) introduced support for type hints. Type hints 
allow, among other things, third-party tools to check Python code for possible 
bugs due to unintentional type mismatches. They also serve as documentation 
for your functions and methods.

Understandably - or maybe surprisingly - there has been a growing interest in 
type hints within the Python community, especially in the last few year; even 
though, outside large code bases, type hints are still not that widely used.

At the same time and for many years, as Python programmers, we are used to 
"duct typing": focusing more on object functionality and interfaces than on 
their types.

Are these two approaches completely at odds with each other?

This extremely practical tutorial will teach you what type hints are and how 
you use them in your own code. We will focus on realistic examples and see how 
type hints can co-exist with Python dynamism and duck-typing. We will explore 
the ways in which type hints can make your code better and in some cases 
faster.

We will use Python 3.8 and strongly recommend that attendees install a 
reasonably recent version of Python 3 to make the most out of the training.
